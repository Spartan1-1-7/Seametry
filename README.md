# Bootcamp ML Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of a machine learning bootcamp where we explore various machine learning techniques and algorithms using Python. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and covers multiple stages of the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Contents

- **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure, characteristics, and any inherent patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks, depending on the project's focus.
- **Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts to illustrate the data distribution, model performance, and other relevant insights.

## Results
- **Model Performance**: A summary of the model's performance metrics.
- **Insights**: Key insights derived from the analysis and modeling.
